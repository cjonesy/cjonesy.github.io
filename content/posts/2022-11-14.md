Ever been working in some code and wonder who you can ask about it without hopping over to github?

This is probably kinda obvious (but wasn't obvious to me at the time):

```shell
alias git-top-committers='git shortlog -s -n --'
```

**Example:**

```shell
~/src/nomad(main)
‚ùØ git-top-committers
  4353  Alex Dadgar
  2321  Michael Schurter
  1799  Michael Lange
  1731  Mahmood Ali
...
```
